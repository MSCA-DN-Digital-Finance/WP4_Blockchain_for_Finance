## Objectives
The WP will focus on driving forward digital innovations through increased adoption of the blockchain technology:
	4.1. To answer the main research questions on solving blockchain deployment hurdles for financial applications.
	4.2. To demonstrate the proposed risk index, fraud detection system and industry standard for blockchain (DEL, RAI, ROY).
	4.3. To disseminate the knowledge, validated by an international research centre (FRA, ECB, ARC)

## Description
WP 4 is led by HUB and supported by all partners. The work is divided into the following tasks:

- Task 4.1. Technical coordination. Monitoring the related IRPs, store the output generated in a location accessible to the entire network.
- Task 4.2. Support the research training for all assigned ESRs and contribute to advanced training content
- Task 4.3. To develop a risk index for cryptos to measure dependencies and spillover effects in tail risk events in the crypto universe.
- Task 4.4. Industry Prototype: To propose a fraud detection system for financial networks with dynamic AI learning models.
- Task 4.5. To propose an industry standard for blockchain applications in finance.
- Task 4.6. Disseminate, communicate and exploit the results (Conferences, OS Day, policy paper, two prototypes, use case, media coverage)

## Deliverables
- D.4.1 White paper on crypto indices: White paper on the construction and the risks involved in crypto indices (Due in M24)
- D.4.2 Policy report on fraud detection: Policy report on fraud detection methods in blockchains and time-series (Due in M48)
- D.4.3 Industry standard for blockchain: Concept for Industry standard for blockchain applications in Finance (Due in M48)
